Since vital tools are missing, this installed version of the engine is not usable yet. This README file will 
be updated as soon as the required tools are implemented and usable.

## Dependencies

This Engine relies on a bunch of 3rd Party libraries. Here is a full list of all of them:

- **GLFW** (http://www.glfw.org/): Source Code has not been altered, but only the files that are required for 
  building the library (this excludes e.g. the examples) have been imported. The CMakeLists.txt files have
  been altered.
- **GLAD** (http://glad.dav1d.de/): None of the files have been altered.
- **SQLite3** (https://www.sqlite.org/index.html): Both the sqlite3.c and sqlite3.h files were altered to 
  allow for the generation of shared libraries.
